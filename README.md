# Mastering Vulnerability Management with Nessus: A Detailed Guide


## Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate my vulnerability management skills by conducting various scans using Nessus, a widely respected tool in cybersecurity. Vulnerability management plays a crucial role in safeguarding an organization’s infrastructure, helping to identify analyze  and prioritize security flaws before they can be exploited. This project delves into the essence of vulnerability management, explains the process of vulnerability assessments and scans, and outlines a structured approach to managing vulnerabilities.


## Lab Architecture

## What is Vulnerability Managment?
Vulnerability management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, and remediating security weaknesses within an organization's infrastructure. Unlike a one-time effort, it is an ongoing, cyclical program aimed at reducing risk over time, prioritizing the most significant vulnerabilities to ensure the organization and its data remain secure. The reality is that no organization can ever fix all vulnerabilities. The goal is strategically directing resources, focusing on high-impact vulnerabilities that present the most pressing risks. By actively managing vulnerabilities, organizations create a defensive posture that mitigates the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.

## What is Vulnerability Assessment?
A vulnerability assessment is a methodical process designed to identify, evaluate, and prioritize vulnerabilities within a given system. Unlike vulnerability management, which is continuous, a vulnerability assessment is usually conducted as a one-time project with a well-defined start and end date. During the assessment, security professionals use specialized tools and techniques to uncover weaknesses such as software bugs, configuration errors, or outdated patches that could serve as gateways for potential attackers.

Once vulnerabilities are discovered, they are analyzed and ranked according to their severity. This enables organizations to understand the risk landscape and focus remediation efforts on the most critical threats. 

## What is a Vulnerability Scan?
A vulnerability scan is an automated process that uses specialized software, such as a vulnerability scanner, to inspect a system for known vulnerabilities. These scans check for issues such as missing security patches, weak configurations, incorrect file permissions, etc. Vulnerability scans are a key part of both vulnerability assessments and ongoing vulnerability management programs, providing a thorough examination of potential weak points across the system.

## The Vulnerability Assessment Framework
An effective vulnerability assessment follows a structured framework to ensure thoroughness and consistency. Below is an outline of a common framework that can be employed:

1. Engagement Planning
The purpose of engagement planning is to define the scope of the assessment, identify critical assets, and outline the objectives. This stage involves communicating with stakeholders to understand the organization's priorities, risk tolerance, and operational constraints.

3. Threat Modeling
Threat modeling helps to anticipate potential attack vectors and identify which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited. By understanding the adversaries, their tactics, and their objectives, security teams can better prioritize efforts.

4. Discovery
During this phase, all systems and components within the scope of the assessment are identified. This includes network devices, servers, applications, and other IT assets. Discovery tools such as Nmap  are used to map the environment and reveal systems that may not have been previously documented.

5. Scanning
Vulnerability scanning is conducted using tools like Nessus to identify known vulnerabilities in the discovered systems. This phase involves both automated scans and manual inspections to uncover weaknesses that can be exploited.

6. Validation
After vulnerabilities are identified, they must be validated to confirm their existence and assess the risk they pose. False positives are eliminated, and vulnerabilities are analyzed in the context of the organization’s specific environment.

7. Remediation
The remediation phase focuses on addressing the vulnerabilities that have been identified and validated. This may involve applying security patches, reconfiguring systems, or implementing additional security controls to mitigate risk.

8. Reporting
A detailed report is compiled, outlining the findings of the assessment, the severity of each vulnerability, and recommendations for remediation. This report should be communicated to stakeholders in a manner that is both comprehensive and actionable.


## Scanning and Reporting with Nessus
For this project, we will focus on the scanning and reporting phases of the vulnerability assessment framework, leveraging the power of Nessus. Nessus provides deep insights into potential security flaws by scanning networks, servers, databases, and applications. It identifies vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, misconfigurations, and weak passwords etc.

In this lab, I demonstrate the ability to use Nessus by running a host discovery, network, credential and web application scan.

## Nessus Host Discovery Scan 
The Nessus Host Discovery Scan is designed to map the network and identify active devices within an organization's infrastructure. This scan helps to create an inventory of hosts, revealing which systems are online and potentially exposed to threats.

## Nessus Network Scan 
The Nessus Network Scan is a more in-depth scan that examines the devices and systems identified in the host discovery phase for known vulnerabilities. This scan inspects network infrastructure, to identify potential security weaknesses such as outdated firmware, open ports, and misconfigurations etc.

## Nessus Credential Scan 
The Nessus Credentialed Scan offers an even deeper level of vulnerability detection by providing the scanner with authorized access to systems and devices. Unlike uncredentialed scans, which examine systems from an external perspective, credentialed scans allow Nessus to log into the systems and perform more thorough checks. This enables the scanner to identify vulnerabilities that may not be visible from the outside, such as missing patches, weak passwords, and insecure configurations.

## Nessus Web Application Scan 
The Nessus Web Application Scan focuses on identifying vulnerabilities within web applications, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure authentication mechanisms.

## Conclusion 
Vulnerability management is an indispensable part of an organization's cybersecurity strategy, offering a structured approach to identifying and addressing weaknesses before they are exploited. Through vulnerability assessments, scans, and ongoing management, security teams can continuously monitor their systems, prioritize threats, and take appropriate actions. In this project, using Nessus for scanning and reporting demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to enhance vulnerability management, providing invaluable insights and driving informed decision-making in the fight against cyber threats.
